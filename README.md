If you want to train or test on your own, you can look at the Pix2PixHD_sample.ipynb for your reference.  
The web interface is under the ./web/ folder, before you use it, you should start the server by running the server.py  
I used FFHQR dataset to train my model, you can download it from this link: https://github.com/skylab-tech/ffhqr-dataset#flickr-faces-hq-retouching-ffhqr-dataset
